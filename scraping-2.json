I have been actively involved in the Web3 industry since 2017, contributing as both an investor and an advisor to a wide range of successful projects.\n\nProject Links\n\ncrazy.meme\n\nPoint of Contact\n\nColeo\n\nDiscord\n\nN/A\n\nKYC/KYB Acknowledgment\n\nYes\n\nTrack\n\nOpen Application\n\nRequested Grant Size\n\n50k ARB\n\nInnovation & Novelty: Highlight what unique aspect or innovation your project brings to Arbitrum\n\nWe aim to attract hundreds of millions of Web3 users and billions of Web2 users to Arbitrum.\n\nWhat users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?\n\nDue to the extreme unfairness in most platforms, 95% of users are afraid to invest in early-stage meme coins, as it’s easy to lose money and difficult to make profit.\nIn fact, many users have left the market after losing money in these early-edge meme coins.\nThe remaining 5% of active users only invest small amounts in them.\n\nHowever, with the true fairness offered by CrazyMeme, all users in Web3, and even those from Web2, will rush to the CrazyMeme platform to buy early-stage meme coins.\nThe market potential is hundreds of times larger than Pump.fun.\n\nWe aim to become the leading DApp, surpassing platforms like Pump.fun. CrazyMeme has the potential to achieve daily profits of $5 million within six months, making us the most profitable DApp in Web3 history.\n\nFunding Breakdown & Spending Plan\n\nContracts development:$250k\nContracts audit:$250k\n\nTeam Experience\n\nWe have a team of 12 people:UI 1,Frontend 3,Backend 3,Smart contract engineer 3,BD 1,Partner 1.\n\nHas the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?\n\nYes\n\nProject Stage\n\nIt's already live on Solana mainnet.\n\nDeployment Date\n\nWe launched an initial version on the Solana mainnet in October and plan to release the final version on the Solana mainnet this month.\nAdditionally, we are currently testing EVM-compatible contracts and aim to launch on Arbitrum next month once the contracts are finalized.\n\nPrevious Performance\n\nThe traction is small because we haven’t done much promotion yet.\n\nHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?\n\nWe have successfully passed the pre-screening stage of the grant program by the Starknet Foundation.\nAlso, we are participating in the Mantle APAC Hackathon.\n\nComparable Projects\n\nWe are quite different from other platforms(pump.fun) in several ways:\n1.We offer a truly fair meme launch, unlike other platforms, which are quite unfair.\n2.We use Dutch auctions, while other platforms do not. In fact, our approach is the opposite of theirs.\n3.We are a DEX, whereas other platforms are not.\n4.We have implemented extensive multi-indicator data for meme coins, which other platforms haven’t yet integrated.\n5.We are deployed across multiple chains.\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nCurrently, the initial liquidity of most meme coins is small, and a few hundred to a few thousand people with limited funds can drive the price up by more than 100 times. As a result, the initial user base is small, and this situation is inherent to the mechanism. Eventually, most of the meme coins will fail.\n\nOn the contrary, CrazyMeme uses Dutch auctions to distribute tokens linearly into the liquidity by block. This allows CrazyMeme meme tokens to accommodate tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of users during the auction cycle. Through this mechanism, the meme coins on CrazyMeme will have a much higher chance of becoming top MEMEs, with the market cap potentially reaching $1B, $10B, or even higher.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nWe spent nearly a year designing and iterating the product,and launched on Solana mainnet last month.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nWe have numerous long-term plans for our product, including:\n1. Mobile Wallet: A feature designed to enable users to conveniently purchase meme coins directly through their smartphones.\n2. Leverage Products: Offering leverage options so users can long meme coins with leverage or even short them.\n3. Social Features: Beyond buying and selling meme coins, we aim to introduce social functionalities, allowing users to spend more time engaging with our platform. A meme coin platform is ideal for incorporating social elements since we anticipate having tens or even hundreds of millions of users in the future. With such a massive user base, developing a social ecosystem would be highly suitable.\n4. Live Streaming/Short Video: We are even exploring the possibility of including live-streaming and short video functionalities in the future.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

The SDK makes it possible to onboard the next millions of developers to web3 by abstracting the complexities of WASM compilation, ABI encoding, and Stylus-specific RPCs fostering a fast and easy development cycle.\n\nOur project bridges the gap for JavaScript developers, allowing them to interact with Stylus smart contracts directly through a JavaScript SDK, which is not currently supported on Stylus.\n\nWhat users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?\n\nWe are solving the problem of over 16.4 million JavaScript developers who are unable to build web3 apps especially on Stylus due to Stylus’s currently limited language to Rust, c & c++.\n\nOur project tackles the following problem but not limited to\n\nBringing new product on-chain: We are addressing the difficulty of integrating existing JavaScript applications with web3 tools. This will make it easy for the integration of blockchain tech to the traditional platform, increasing the creation of new applications on arbitrum.\n\nChallenge with integration: This project will provide a seamless interoperability with JavaScript ecosystems, bridging the gap between JavaScript and WASM for Stylus compatibility.\n\nCumbersome Workflows: This SDK simplifies the complex process of compiling and managing WASM binaries, making contract deployment faster and easier.\n\nFunding Breakdown & Spending Plan\n\nkindly check out this doc: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E1_Vk_OJj5L_byhAJLLUfTT_D4QEwCO8vNAjQUtlWLw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDevelopment Cost: 120,000 ARB Project Duration: 24 weeks Hours per Week: 50 hours (team members) Total Hours: 24 weeks × 50 hours = 1,200 hours Hourly Rate: 80 ARB/hour Total Development Cost: 1,200 hours × 80 ARB = 96,000 ARB Additional Costs (Tooling, Testing, Reviews): 24,000 ARB Total Development Cost: 96,000 ARB + 24,000 ARB = 120,000 ARB\n\nSecurity Audit: 30,000 ARB\nEstimated cost for a reputable third-party auditing firm to review the Web Assembly modules, SDK integrity, and blockchain integration vulnerabilities.

We received an educational grant which positioned us as one of the first set of individuals to try out stylus before it went live on mainnet.\n\nWe explored stylus with over 100+ developers and the feedback gathered during the program was our source of inspiration for this project - creating a tool that allows stylus accessible to native developers.\nLink to report: \n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-report-arbitrum-dapps-over-apps/27276?u=supercoolkay\n\nComparable Projects\n\nNone.\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nThis project expands Arbitrum's reach by enabling JavaScript developers who make up a large percentage of the global developer community, to build on Stylus without needing to learn Rust or C++, significantly lowering entry barriers.\n\nJavaScript powers a majority of web applications, so our SDK allows these developers to integrate Arbitrum directly into existing apps, enhancing functionality with minimal adjustment. By offering a JavaScript SDK that works with popular tools like ethers.js and web3.js, we make Arbitrum accessible to both web2 and web3 projects.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nKindly check out our implementation plan: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/1oS-5UPjZ9q7BBHfbpye3-LLnBYAEMFJt/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword\n\nYes, we spent many weeks conducting due diligence and analyzing the feasibility of our project. The Stylus JavaScript SDK provides a practical solution for developers by offering a simpler, more accessible alternative to the AssemblyScript SDK.\n\nWhile AssemblyScript supports TypeScript-like syntax, the JavaScript SDK removes the need to handle WebAssembly-specific requirements like static typing and manual memory management. Features such as adaptCodeForWasm() and toolSelector() let developers use standard JavaScript without worrying about underlying constraints.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nToolchain Compatibility and Updates: Quarterly evaluations of AssemblyScript and Emscripten ensure compatibility, with updates applied to toolSelector() and findings documented.\n\nSDK and Dependency Maintenance: Regular updates to setup.js, build.js, and sdk-cli.js ensure dependency alignment and backward compatibility across versions.\n\nWasm Codebase Efficiency: Biannual refactoring of adaptCodeForWasm() ensures alignment with WebAssembly standards, with periodic validation of memory models.\n\nRobust Compilation and Error Handling: Regular testing of compileToWasm() and wasmDebug() addresses diverse scenarios, with updated build scripts and automated error reporting.\n\nArbitrum Integration and Interactivity: Integration tests and updates ensure connectToArbitrumStylus() and ethers.js/web3.js wrappers function seamlessly with the Arbitrum API.\n\nPerformance Optimization and Debugging: Quarterly reviews of optimization tools and reports address bottlenecks and refine performance metrics for resource usage.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring: Automated pipelines ensure reliable deployments to Arbitrum networks, with continuous monitoring and alerts for anomalies.\n\nDocumentation and Developer Experience: SDK documentation and templates are updated after major changes, incorporating developer feedback to improve usability.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\nAbdulkareem Oyeneye\n\nBuilder\n\n02 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\nAbdulkareem Oyeneye\n\nBuilder\n\n03 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\nAbdulkareem Oyeneye\n\nBuilder\n\n03 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\nAbdulkareem Oyeneye\n\nBuilder\n\n18 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

It’s focus is on social/gaming, and already has a rich and energetic grassroots culture of developers and builders. Without VC funding it has quickly become one of the top L3 orbit chains due to cult community and meme-ability. Every transaction on-chain has a burning mechanism that burns the native gas token $DMT. \n\n\nTheir first major product, \nSanko.tv\n, shipped over a year ago and at the time was the first of its kind. Their second major product is SankoPets, an on-chain pet simulator with built-in defi mechanisms. In order to stake $DMT users must own a pet. These pets can also farm Fruit and sell them for native gaming token SankoGold.\n\n\nWe want to build a mobile p2e JRPG game that leverages these assets emitted from Sankopets. \n\n\nIn Super Tiny World, players create a character between 3 different classes and play through a scenario to level out their character and earn $ZENNY along the way. This $ZENNY will be used to purchase short term buffs, swap out gear, purchase extra character slots, purchase Potions (created from Sankopets ‘Fruit’) or SankoGold.\n\n\nDuring the scenario, players will have so much Stamina to expend throughout their playtime, diminishing their stats to a weakened state. Players can risk continuing in a weakened state, losing their $ZENNY if they fail to complete the stage, partner up with others sharing $ZENNY and XP gained, purchase Potions to regain their energy, or wait for their Stamina to slowly replenish over time.\n\n\nIn order to upgrade their character, players will need to earn the XP through playing the game to unlock skills and purchase and use SankoGold to unlock. Weapon variety will be utilized in the game to balance out gameplay, while specific rarity or weapons will be flattened so rare equipment is only for aesthetic purposes like skins, that can be owned in wallet and traded as NFTs.\n\n\nThe game will start with an initial player base of 8,888 NFT holders, later onboarding a F2P player base. In order to onboard free players, we will utilize a ERC-404 with single sided swapping mechanism. Every 1 NFT burned will add an amount to distributed supply, and open up a batch of F2P players. We will have a burning mechanism built in, so every transaction burns $ZENNY, so in times when player growth is stagnant the token becomes deflationary. There will also be a built in mechanism in the game to buy-back and burn NFTs to continue onboarding new players through player interaction.\n\n\nThe leveraging of secondary assets from Sankopets allows us to reward early liquidity providers and lock up a percentage of distributed/circulating $ZENNY supply through a 3 or 6 month unbonding period, which will prevent tokens earned in game from being insta-dumped. We want to encourage players to spend $ZENNY earned in-game on playing the game and building out their characters.\n\n\nUltimately, Super Tiny World is not just a game, but a way for players to build out an identity on-chain they will be able to utilize in other experiences in the future in Sanko. We want players to have as much freedom in creating their characters as possible. Asset ownership in gaming is an opportunity for artists to have a living canvas, and for their work to be expressed as an IP. Games can become IP factories to build brand recognition across a variety of platforms. Someone sees a sword, hat, or specific design, and they immediately can identify it back to a specific artist or game.\n\nMember Details\n\n1. Huffy (Director)\n\n2.

Who is your intended target audience?\n\nWe want to reduce the cost and friction of a play-to-earn game in a massive F2P mobile gaming market while maintaining healthy, sustainable growth and an ecosystem that is long-term deflationary in periods of stagnant player growth.

Today, each wallet can only hold a narrow slice of a user’s onchain reputation, leading to fragmented scores and suboptimal trust signals. We will integrate with Arbitrum Stylus to implement a contract flow inspired by Tornado Cash, but for credential proofs instead of tokens. Users “deposit” credential proofs from various wallets into a Stylus-powered contract. Later, from any chosen address, they can present a zero-knowledge style proof that they hold these credentials—without revealing the source wallets. This process enhances Sybil resistance, improves user experience, and preserves privacy. By leveraging WASM and Rust-based logic via Stylus, we reduce gas costs and complexity, making onchain identity aggregation more accessible. The final result is a seamless, privacy-focused identity layer ready to serve dApps, DAOs, and DeFi projects on Arbitrum.\n\nMember Details\n\n1.

By leveraging Arbitrum Stylus, we can implement efficient, cost-effective verification logic in WASM for complex identity proofs—similar to Tornado Cash’s deposit/withdrawal privacy mechanics, but for credentials instead of tokens. This enables trustless, Sybil-resistant identity aggregation without linking personal addresses directly, preserving user privacy. The innovation lies in making these advanced credential proofs cheaper and more accessible on Arbitrum, unlocking frictionless human-verification use cases for dApps and communities. And showcasing how Stylus’s low cost computation enables identity and other use cases that cannot occur due to high gas costs on mainnet.\n\nWhat users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?\n\nOur solution targets both end-users and Web3 projects that rely on Sybil-resistant identities. Current identity solutions are fragmented; users often build reputations across multiple wallets, but cannot easily combine them without doxxing themselves. This leads to lower-quality scores, reduced access to gated benefits, and complexity in proving one’s trustworthiness. Our intended audience includes:\n\nUsers: Who want to prove unique humanity without linking multiple wallets publicly.\nPartners & dApps: That require high-quality, Sybil-resistant user bases for rewards, governance, and community-building.\n\nBy enabling privacy-preserving multi-wallet identity aggregation, we simplify verification, boost user participation, and increase overall ecosystem trust.\n\nFunding Breakdown & Spending Plan\n\nTotal Request: 100k ARB\n\nDevelopment & Engineering (60k ARB)\nImplementing the Stylus-based credential aggregation contracts, integrating Rust-based ZK or privacy proofs, and optimizing for gas costs.\nInterface design and front end development (20k ARB)\nDesigning and implementing a new user interface for app.passport.xyz to enable users to claim on multiple wallets.\nTesting & Integration (10k ARB)\nDeploying to testnets, refining UX, and stress-testing performance.\nDocumentation & Community Outreach (10k ARB)\nCreating developer guides, user instructions, and onboarding materials for partners and end-users.\n\nTeam Experience\n\nOur core team combines expertise in Web3 identity, privacy, and smart contract engineering.\n\nThe team has collectively launched multiple production-grade dApps, integrated complex off-chain verification flows, and implemented advanced cryptographic tooling.\n\nOur experience bridging user-friendly front-ends with robust, privacy-focused back-end infrastructures uniquely qualifies us to deliver a secure, efficient, and intuitive privacy-preserving identity aggregation solution on Arbitrum Stylus.\n\nHas the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?\n\nYes\n\nProject Stage\n\nWe currently have a functioning identity verification platform (app.passport.xyz) and are in the design phase for extending it to multi-wallet privacy aggregation. We have identified the approach, feasibility, and cost. Upon grant approval, we can begin immediate development.\n\nDeployment Date\n\n6-8 weeks after funding, to allow for us to balance and make room in our roadmap\n\nPrevious Performance\n\nPassport XYZ has successfully deployed and operated its identity verification platform, integrating a variety of credential sources and achieving traction with Web3 projects looking to combat Sybil attacks.\n\nOur existing Passport App has onboarded 2 million users who have verified Stamps and established onchain identities.\n\nWe have partnered with 100+ communities and dApps to ensure that their token distributions and governance activities benefit unique, high-quality participants.\n\nHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?\n\nYes – We received a 24k ARB Fire Starter grant from Thank ARB. We have also received grants from Optimism’s RPGF and Gitcoin Grants GG22.\n\nComparable Projects\n\nOther Web3 identity solutions often rely on static claims or singular verification pathways, limiting their flexibility and utility. BrightID uses a social-graph approach, Proof of Humanity relies on community-curated registries, Worldcoin explores biometric verification, and IDENA conducts synchronous ceremonies. While these solutions help prove uniqueness, they lack composability and privacy-preserving aggregation. Our approach enables users to aggregate identity attributes—stamps, credentials\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nBy making it easier for users to establish stronger, Sybil-resistant reputations without sacrificing privacy, our solution will encourage broader participation in governance, reward programs, and other community-driven initiatives on Arbitrum. This leads to a healthier ecosystem with improved user trust and better incentive alignment. As more partners integrate and rely on privacy-preserving identity scoring, the Arbitrum ecosystem can expand its user base and unlock more sophisticated use cases—such as fair airdrops, Sybil-resistance voting, and tailored access to protocols—ultimately driving increased adoption, high quality engagement, retention, and utility within the Arbitrum network.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nWe have experience integrating various identity Stamps and working with privacy-focused proof systems. Stylus’ WASM execution environment allows us to leverage Rust-based cryptographic libraries. We have surveyed the Rust and WASM ecosystems for suitable ZK libraries (e.g., arkworks) and have confirmed compatibility with Stylus. The approach is feasible given the team’s technical background and the existence of robust Rust crates.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nThis functionality will be integrated directly into Passport XYZ, a revenue-generating platform. Ongoing fees from partners using our Sybil-resistant scoring and consulting services will sustain maintenance and future development. As more dApps adopt privacy-preserving unique-human verification, demand grows. We will actively maintain and upgrade contracts, continue user education, and cultivate community involvement, ensuring relevance beyond the initial grant period.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\nDaniel Brunsdon\n\nBuilder\n\n17 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\nDaniel Brunsdon\n\nBuilder\n\n17 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

We also created cairovm.codes, the official Cairo VM playground, which required deep knowledge of the Cairo VM and Cairo Compiler.\n\nHaving completed Cairo VM Codes, our team is ready for its next challenge—improving debugging tools for Arbitrum Stylus. Our experience with Starknet, including implementing call traces, transaction debugger and simulator, makes us well-suited for this project. Our long-term interest in cross-VM debugging aligns with becoming a strategic partner for Arbitrum.\n\nRead more about our vision here: \n\nhttps://walnut.dev/blog/why-blockchains-mark-new-era-for-debugging-and-monitoring-services\n\nHas the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?\n\nYes\n\nProject Stage\n\nMVP\n\nDeployment Date\n\nN/A\n\nPrevious Performance\n\nN/A\n\nHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?\n\nWe did receive multiple grants from other ecosystems, notably:\n\nStarknet and Starkware (for building cairovm.codes and walnut.dev)\nOptimism Foundation (for building op-scan (\n\nhttps://github.com/walnuthq/op-scan\n\n) and improving debugging on the EVM (\n\nhttps://walnut.dev/blog/walnut-receives-grant-from-optimism-foundation-to-improve-debugging-on-the-superchain\n\n))\nAztec (for building a Noir package registry, no link yet)\n\nWe did not yet receive a grant from any Arbitrum ecosystem related program.\n\nComparable Projects\n\nZKsync test in-memory node (\n\nhttps://docs.zksync.io/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node\n\n)\nGDB\nTenderly and Walnut for debugging onchain transactions\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nResearch shows that developers spend nearly 50% of their time debugging when building applications.

    "milestonesText": "Milestones\n\n01\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Trace command to output user-defined Rust functions including hierarchy between calls\n\n57000 ARB\n\nForked the existing cargo stylus repository (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus), and added an extension to the cargo stylus trace command with support for trace output with user-defined Rust functions. The trace output will include external and internal calls function names (as written in Rust), not-decoded arguments, not-decoded return values, and line numbers, along with a hierarchical view of function calls to illustrate the sequence and nesting of calls. The PR will contain detailed instructions on how to run it and generate the aforementioned call trace details. Note: to preserve the old trace format, we can add a new flag to cargo stylus trace, i.e. --raw, which will generate the current trace format. Alternatively, we could keep the default behaviour as-is and generate our new trace under a flag, i.e. --new-trace. We propose to leave this decision on the PR review and discuss it as part of the PR review process. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 28 Feb, 2025\n\n02\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Trace command output with decoded return values, parameters and entrypoint names\n\n44000 ARB\n\nExtend the forked cargo stylus trace repository, add cargo stylus trace output with decoded parameters and return values, and includes contracts addresses. Entrypoint names will be presented in a human-readable format using information from the ABI. The PR will contain detailed instructions on how to run it and generate the aforementioned call trace details. Note: we will follow the same practice about a CLI flag to distinguish between the existing call trace output and the new output, as discussed in Milestone 1. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 21 Mar, 2025\n\n03\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Trace command to support multi-VM transactions that involve Solidity and Rust\n\n57000 ARB\n\nEnhance the forked cargo stylus trace command with support for transactions involving both Solidity and Stylus contracts. After this Milestone, the cargo stylus trace command will present a full trace containing information from both Solidity and Stylus Contracts. The trace output for the Solidity part of the transaction will only contain external contract calls, with contract address and decoded entrypoint name. The Rust part of the trace will contain all details delivered in previous milestones – namely contract names, entrypoint names, external and internal function calls, arguments and results. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 11 Apr, 2025\n\n04\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Replay to support debugging a transaction with multiple Stylus contract calls\n\n57000 ARB\n\nUpdate the forked cargo stylus repository with support for the replay command to debug transactions involving multiple Stylus contract calls. Note: Debugging will only be supported for Stylus contracts with provided source code (via CLI parameter). Contracts with no source code will be naturally skipped in the debugger experience. For example, in case of the following contract sequence: Contract A > Contract B (no source code) > Contract A User will be able to seamlessly debug the transaction like this: Debugging starts in Contract A with full debugger experience including variable inspection and line numbers Moves to Contract B and notifies the user there is no source code provided, so no internal details about the Contract B. User is however able to move next to Contract A Contract A again, with full debugging experience\n\nDeadline: 09 May, 2025\n\n05\n\nCargo Stylus Replay command support for debugging Stylus transactions that involve calls to Solidity Contracts\n\n44000 ARB\n\nExtend the forked cargo stylus replay command with support for transactions that involve one or multiple calls to Solidity Contracts. Notes: Full debugging experience, with variable inspection and line numbers, will only be available on Stylus contracts with source code provided. See previous Milestone 5. For Stylus Contracts with no source code, the debugger will be able to present information that the Source Code is missing and hence there is nothing to debug. The debugger will be capable of moving to the next contract. Same as in previous Milestone 5. For Solidity Contracts, the debugger will just show basic information such as contract address, entrypoint name as well as information that it’s a Solidity Contract. It will allow the user to move the debugger on to the next contract. Full Debugger Experience for Solidity contracts is not part of this milestone. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 30 May, 2025\n\n06\n\nCargo Stylus Replay command variables pretty-printing\n\n31000 ARB\n\nCreated and merged PR to cargo stylus repository, that implements pretty-printing for basic types, such as U256, within the cargo stylus replay command. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 13 Jun, 2025\n\n07\n\nLong-term support and (potential) merge\n\n180000 ARB\n\n12-month support and ongoing maintenance of the forked debugging tooling, with regular merges of upstream changes. Dedicated telegram group support for technical issues with the tooling. Kickoff discussions with Offchain Labs about merging the forked repositories into the official toolset.

Note: we will follow the same practice about a CLI flag to distinguish between the existing call trace output and the new output, as discussed in Milestone 1. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 21 Mar, 2025\n\n03\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Trace command to support multi-VM transactions that involve Solidity and Rust\n\n57000 ARB\n\nEnhance the forked cargo stylus trace command with support for transactions involving both Solidity and Stylus contracts. After this Milestone, the cargo stylus trace command will present a full trace containing information from both Solidity and Stylus Contracts. The trace output for the Solidity part of the transaction will only contain external contract calls, with contract address and decoded entrypoint name. The Rust part of the trace will contain all details delivered in previous milestones – namely contract names, entrypoint names, external and internal function calls, arguments and results. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 11 Apr, 2025\n\n04\n\nEnhance Cargo Stylus Replay to support debugging a transaction with multiple Stylus contract calls\n\n57000 ARB\n\nUpdate the forked cargo stylus repository with support for the replay command to debug transactions involving multiple Stylus contract calls. Note: Debugging will only be supported for Stylus contracts with provided source code (via CLI parameter). Contracts with no source code will be naturally skipped in the debugger experience. For example, in case of the following contract sequence: Contract A > Contract B (no source code) > Contract A User will be able to seamlessly debug the transaction like this: Debugging starts in Contract A with full debugger experience including variable inspection and line numbers Moves to Contract B and notifies the user there is no source code provided, so no internal details about the Contract B. User is however able to move next to Contract A Contract A again, with full debugging experience\n\nDeadline: 09 May, 2025\n\n05\n\nCargo Stylus Replay command support for debugging Stylus transactions that involve calls to Solidity Contracts\n\n44000 ARB\n\nExtend the forked cargo stylus replay command with support for transactions that involve one or multiple calls to Solidity Contracts. Notes: Full debugging experience, with variable inspection and line numbers, will only be available on Stylus contracts with source code provided. See previous Milestone 5. For Stylus Contracts with no source code, the debugger will be able to present information that the Source Code is missing and hence there is nothing to debug. The debugger will be capable of moving to the next contract. Same as in previous Milestone 5. For Solidity Contracts, the debugger will just show basic information such as contract address, entrypoint name as well as information that it’s a Solidity Contract. It will allow the user to move the debugger on to the next contract. Full Debugger Experience for Solidity contracts is not part of this milestone. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 30 May, 2025\n\n06\n\nCargo Stylus Replay command variables pretty-printing\n\n31000 ARB\n\nCreated and merged PR to cargo stylus repository, that implements pretty-printing for basic types, such as U256, within the cargo stylus replay command. Write documentation with information about all new features added and how to use them.\n\nDeadline: 13 Jun, 2025\n\n07\n\nLong-term support and (potential) merge\n\n180000 ARB\n\n12-month support and ongoing maintenance of the forked debugging tooling, with regular merges of upstream changes. Dedicated telegram group support for technical issues with the tooling. Kickoff discussions with Offchain Labs about merging the forked repositories into the official toolset. Offer guidance and support with the merge (if happening).\n\nDeadline: 13 Jun, 2026\n\nReviews\n\nReview With\n\nRubrics\n\nPayouts"

Unlike traditional data platforms reliant on APIs and centralized endpoints, our SDK eliminates intermediaries, offering a decentralized and transparent solution.\n\n\nStylus contracts will incorporate Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) via Microsoft SEAL, on-device zkProof generation, and on-chain SQLite databases. Developed in Rust and C++, the SDK allows encrypted data to be processed in smart contracts without revealing private information. This enables privacy-preserving real-world applications such as energy and traffic flow optimization and environmental monitoring, all with guaranteed data confidentiality.\n\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the architecture we’re building and the tools we’ll add to Stylus, all of which will be open-source for developers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSQLite Database on Stylus Smart Contracts: Integrates SQLite3 for efficient, lightweight on-chain data management.\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Enables secure, privacy-preserving processing of SQLite data on-chain using Microsoft SEAL.\nzkProofs for Data Validation: Verifies real-world data directly with zkproof generation directly on-device and stored on-chain\nIoT Device Access: Allows IoT devices to interact with Stylus smart contracts without APIs or oracles, ensuring deterministic outcomes.\nThese tools go beyond the needs of our project, unlocking new possibilities for the Arbitrum ecosystem. With this funding, we aim to create a suite of open-source resources that empower developers to build their own innovative projects.\n\n\nAdditionally, the SDK supports the creation of modular “City-Chains” on Arbitrum Orbit, empowering local stakeholders and communities to leverage Web3 liquidity for localized Smart City and decentralized services. This aligns with Arbitrum’s goals of scalability and decentralization while enabling practical, community-focused applications.\n\nMember Details\n\n1.

This tool addresses a critical need in the developer journey, enabling both property-based fuzzing and advanced debugging for Rust-based smart contracts on Stylus. By providing a seamless testing solution, we aim to accelerate developer adoption of Stylus and enhance the overall security and reliability of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Furthermore, this tool will attract security researchers and protocol teams, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of secure decentralized applications.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nWe plan to implement StylusFuzz in three phases: building a prototype with core Stylus support, extending to full contract support, and optimizing UX and performance for adoption. Our tools leverage the K framework, enabling us to extend KWasm semantics with Stylus-specific host functions. This approach ensures seamless integration with the Stylus environment and robust testing capabilities. Our expertise with similar tools, like Komet for Stellar, and engagement with the Stylus team validate the feasibility and demand for this solution in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nTo ensure long-term project sustainability, Runtime Verification will continue to support and maintain the tool as open-source. We plan to integrate CI pipeline support for enterprise users and provide managed infrastructure for large-scale fuzzing through premium offerings. The tool will evolve with community contributions and will remain accessible under an OSI-compliant license. Potential risks include updates in Arbitrum’s infrastructure, which we plan to mitigate by closely collaborating with the Stylus team and maintaining flexibility in our architecture.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\nRuntime Verification (Everett Hildenbrandt / Gregory Makodzeba)\n\nBuilder\n\n04 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\nRuntime Verification (Everett Hildenbrandt / Gregory Makodzeba)\n\nBuilder\n\n04 Dec\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",
    "milestonesText": "Milestones\n\n01\n\nInitial Fuzzing Tool Prototype for Stylus\n\n62500 ARB\n\n1. Open-source BSD-3 licensed repository containing the core fuzzing tool for Stylus. This repository will: - import the KWasm semantics and extend it with Stylus host functions. - contain a test harness and a test suite for Stylus. 2. Initial implementation of a Stylus smart contract execution environment in K using KWasm extended with Stylus host functions. 3. Initial support for writing Rust-based property tests for Stylus contracts compiled to WebAssembly and executing them using fuzzing. 4. Test suite on every pull request to ensure that no functionality is broken. 5. Rust-based property tests for Renegade contracts to demonstrate tool functionality and correctness. 6. Gather feedback on the tool's usability and functionality. To accurately simulate the Stylus execution environment and ensure comprehensive fuzzing capabilities, we will implement support for the following Stylus host functions used in the Renegade contracts: https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/tree/main : - Instances explicitly used in darkpool_core.rs: call::static_call evm::log - Instances explicitly used in darkpool.rs: evm::log msg::sender - Instances explicitly used in merkle.rs: evm::log - Instances explicitly used in transfer_executor.rs: contract::address evm::log - Instances explicitly used in helpers.rs: Call::call Call::delegate_call Call::static_call - Instances explicitly used in backend.rs: call::RawCall crypto::keccak (uses internally alloy_primitives::keccak256) These host functions are critical for interacting with the Arbitrum blockchain and are essential for the functionality of Stylus smart contracts. Note: While we have identified these host functions through our initial research, it's possible that additional host functions may be used in Stylus contracts, especially as we delve deeper into the codebase or as new functionalities are introduced.\n\nDeadline: 01 Mar, 2025\n\n02\n\nFull Support for Stylus Contracts\n\n150000 ARB\n\n1. Implementation of all Stylus host functions to ensure that the tool can execute all types of Stylus smart contracts. 2. Full fuzzing support for all Stylus contracts, allowing developers to fuzz any Rust-based contract compiled to WASM. 3. Extensive documentation and tutorials to guide developers in using the tool for different types of contracts. 4. Integration with Solidity contracts to test Stylus-Solidity interactions through property-based fuzzing. 5. Integrate feedback from Phase 1 into tool improvements and feature enhancements.\n\nDeadline: 01 Jun, 2025\n\n03\n\nUX and Performance Optimization\n\n150000 ARB\n\n1. Enhanced user interface and developer experience, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the fuzzing process smoother. 2. Performance optimizations to handle larger contracts and more complex test cases with minimal overhead. 3.

Ramen Rumble fills this gap by offering an engaging platform that attracts and retains players, bringing a new audience to Arbitrum. By leveraging Arbitrum Stylus’s high performance and scalability, the game ensures seamless gameplay for a large user base with multiple smart contracts, showcasing Stylus’s capabilities and positioning Arbitrum as a top platform for Web3 gaming.\n\nWhat users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?\n\nMost Web3 games prioritize blockchain features over gameplay, leading to a lack of engaging experiences and short gaming sessions. Our game, Ramen Rumble, flips this paradigm by keeping blockchain technology hidden in the background. This ensures seamless, immersive gameplay designed for long, social gaming sessions with friends. Additionally, our approach simplifies onboarding for Web2 players, enabling massive adoption without the complexity typically associated with Web3.\n\nFunding Breakdown & Spending Plan\n\nProgramming: ARB 31,000\nSmart contract: ARB 5,000\nArt and design: ARB 16,000\nUI/UX: ARB 3000\nSound design: $5,500\nServers & Tech Stack Subscription: $9,500\n\nTeam Experience\n\nWe are starting Level29 Games, a game development studio. Manish, the CEO, has 7+ years of experience in the industry, while Sumedha, the COO and 3D artist, brings over 5 years of experience.\nOur development team is led by Aman and Vikas, who together have 10+ years of expertise in game development and blockchain.\nSaurabh, who leads the marketing team (7+ years experience), specializes in user acquisition and viral marketing, having worked with major brands like Audi and Nazara Gaming (India’s largest gaming company). This combination of leadership, technical expertise, and marketing experience positions us to build and scale innovative games like Ramen Rumble.\n\nHas the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?\n\nYes\n\nProject Stage\n\nMVP. Core gameplay loop, NFT integration, and basic UI are implemented. Actively playtesting and iterating based on feedback. Started working on Multiplayer and Clan features.(Did close alpha testing with over 1000 players in span of 15 days)\n\nDeployment Date\n\nPrevious Performance\n\nHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?\n\nWe received a grant from AppLayer, but their funding is delayed as they postponed their TGE to end of Q1 2025.\n\nComparable Projects\n\nThere are no direct comparable projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The closest Web2 project is Clash of Clans, which features clan management and competitive gameplay. Ramen Rumble brings similar features but with more immersion to Web3, enhancing them with NFTs and decentralized economies, offering unique value to Arbitrum.'\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nOur project, Ramen Rumble, is designed to attract a massive new audience to the Arbitrum ecosystem by bridging Web2 and Web3 gaming. With immersive gameplay that hides blockchain complexity, we simplify onboarding for non-crypto-native players while providing advanced features for Web3 enthusiasts. By integrating Arbitrum’s high-performance infrastructure, we showcase its scalability for gaming applications, encouraging other game developers to build on Arbitrum. Additionally, the game’s use of NFTs, in-game economies, and community-driven events fosters engagement and retention, creating a thriving user base. This growth not only boosts adoption but also attracts new projects and protocols seeking to tap into Arbitrum’s vibrant ecosystem.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nWe are currently in the MVP stage and have conducted due diligence regarding the tools and frameworks to implement our project. We use Unity as our primary game engine for its versatility and cross-platform support. For multiplayer functionality, we rely on Photon, ensuring smooth and scalable real-time interactions. Thirdweb API facilitates seamless logins, wallet integrations, and onramp solutions, simplifying onboarding. Firebase serves as our database for robust and scalable backend operations, while Bunny.net is used as a distribution server to ensure efficient and fast content delivery. These tools collectively enable us to deliver a high-quality, scalable product.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nRamen Rumble's long-term sustainability relies on a multi-faceted approach:\n• Diverse Revenue Streams: NFTs, in-app purchases, and non-intrusive ads ensure ongoing income.\n• Community Building: We are fostering a dedicated community through regular events, competitions, and content updates, increasing player retention.\n• Content Roadmap: Expanding gameplay with new features, dishes, weapons, and game modes will maintain player interest and attract new users.\n• Partnerships: Collaborating with other projects and DAOs will enhance visibility and broaden our reach.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\nManish Kumar\n\nBuilder\n\n29 Nov\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

By eliminating centralized control and geographic restrictions, the DPP combines the transparency of decentralized finance with the excitement of sports and event prediction markets. Users can place bets using any token, including $ETH, $SP, or other cryptocurrencies, thanks to seamless cross-chain functionality powered by LayerZero Core. With parlay options, users can create multi-bet combinations that compound odds for significant payouts—turning a series of accurate predictions into exponential rewards. Built on Arbitrum Stylus, the DPP ensures scalability, ultra-low transaction costs, and optimal performance, setting a new standard for decentralized betting platforms.\n\n\nA standout feature of the DPP is its NFT-driven functionality, where each parlay sheet is minted as a unique NFT. This innovation transforms betting into a tradeable and liquid asset class. Users can buy, sell, or exchange these NFTs on \nOverTheCounter.meme\n, Smoovie Phone’s decentralized P2P token exchange. This feature allows users to enter or exit betting positions dynamically, even after the betting window closes, by acquiring parlay sheets from other users. Combined with the platform’s seamless Rust-based architecture on Stylus, this functionality creates an intersection of DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, delivering a holistic and flexible betting experience. By turning bets into assets, the DPP introduces a decentralized and community-driven secondary market that amplifies the excitement and accessibility of the platform.\n\n\nThe “Be the Bank” feature further enhances the platform by empowering users to act as liquidity providers. By depositing tokens like $ETH or $SP into the platform's rewards pool, users can earn passive yield from parlay sheets that fail to win. This mechanism shares profits with liquidity providers, creating an ecosystem where participants collectively benefit from platform activity. The rewards pool is transparently managed on Arbitrum Stylus, leveraging its performance capabilities for seamless fund management and instant profit distribution. This DeFi-inspired functionality democratizes the betting process, enabling users to profit in ways previously limited to centralized betting operators.\n\n\nThe platform’s user interface (UI) is a visual and functional delight, blending retro gaming aesthetics with cutting-edge technology. Inspired by Sanko Predicts, the UI features parlay sheets that resemble handwritten notes, adding a personal and nostalgic touch to the betting experience. Victories are celebrated with dynamic animations that enhance the thrill of winning. Additionally, the DPP features a live chat function, enabling users to connect with bettors worldwide or interact directly with kAia, the platform’s AI assistant. From resolving queries and providing betting insights to sharing market updates and engaging users with playful banter, kAia ensures a seamless and engaging experience for all participants.\nAt the core of the DPP’s technical infrastructure is Arbitrum Stylus, enabling high-performance operations and seamless multi-chain interactions. The Rust-based architecture allows for rapid bet resolutions, transparent odds management, and efficient NFT minting. Stylus also powers kAia’s AI-driven functionalities, ensuring real-time data integration and robust user support. By integrating Stylus, the DPP delivers a frictionless and innovative experience that transforms decentralized betting into an empowering and scalable ecosystem.

Built on Arbitrum Stylus, the DPP ensures scalability, ultra-low transaction costs, and optimal performance, setting a new standard for decentralized betting platforms.\n\n\nA standout feature of the DPP is its NFT-driven functionality, where each parlay sheet is minted as a unique NFT. This innovation transforms betting into a tradeable and liquid asset class. Users can buy, sell, or exchange these NFTs on \nOverTheCounter.meme\n, Smoovie Phone’s decentralized P2P token exchange. This feature allows users to enter or exit betting positions dynamically, even after the betting window closes, by acquiring parlay sheets from other users. Combined with the platform’s seamless Rust-based architecture on Stylus, this functionality creates an intersection of DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, delivering a holistic and flexible betting experience. By turning bets into assets, the DPP introduces a decentralized and community-driven secondary market that amplifies the excitement and accessibility of the platform.\n\n\nThe “Be the Bank” feature further enhances the platform by empowering users to act as liquidity providers. By depositing tokens like $ETH or $SP into the platform's rewards pool, users can earn passive yield from parlay sheets that fail to win. This mechanism shares profits with liquidity providers, creating an ecosystem where participants collectively benefit from platform activity. The rewards pool is transparently managed on Arbitrum Stylus, leveraging its performance capabilities for seamless fund management and instant profit distribution. This DeFi-inspired functionality democratizes the betting process, enabling users to profit in ways previously limited to centralized betting operators.\n\n\nThe platform’s user interface (UI) is a visual and functional delight, blending retro gaming aesthetics with cutting-edge technology. Inspired by Sanko Predicts, the UI features parlay sheets that resemble handwritten notes, adding a personal and nostalgic touch to the betting experience. Victories are celebrated with dynamic animations that enhance the thrill of winning. Additionally, the DPP features a live chat function, enabling users to connect with bettors worldwide or interact directly with kAia, the platform’s AI assistant. From resolving queries and providing betting insights to sharing market updates and engaging users with playful banter, kAia ensures a seamless and engaging experience for all participants.\nAt the core of the DPP’s technical infrastructure is Arbitrum Stylus, enabling high-performance operations and seamless multi-chain interactions. The Rust-based architecture allows for rapid bet resolutions, transparent odds management, and efficient NFT minting. Stylus also powers kAia’s AI-driven functionalities, ensuring real-time data integration and robust user support. By integrating Stylus, the DPP delivers a frictionless and innovative experience that transforms decentralized betting into an empowering and scalable ecosystem. With tradable NFT parlay sheets, the “Be the Bank” liquidity model, and an intuitive UI enhanced by kAia’s support, the DPP is poised to redefine crypto betting, setting a precedent for decentralized applications in Web3.\n\nMember Details\n\n1. revolver ocelot\n\nProject Links\n\nhttps://sankopredicts.com/\n\n, smooviephone.com (all products)\n\nPoint of Contact\n\n0xsimplefarmer\n\nDiscord\n\n@simplefarmer7\n\nKYC/KYB Acknowledgment\n\nYes\n\nTrack\n\nOpen Application\n\nRequested Grant Size\n\n420,000 $ARB\n\nInnovation & Novelty: Highlight what unique aspect or innovation your project brings to Arbitrum\n\nThe be the bank feature where users can take the position of the bank deposit tokens and earn yield from parlay bets places , also the model includes A.I resolving bets which is unique to the market at this time.\n\nWhat users and pain points in the market does this project solve for?

Who is your intended target audience?\n\nTarget Audience: Gamers in Southeast Asia across multiple Web 2 game titles, including Call of Duty Mobile, Mobile Legends, Valorant, League of Legends, Honor of Kings, and many more.\n\nPain Points: Even though Zodiacs Gaming has a large community and big plans, we struggle with blockchain development, which makes it hard to keep players engaged. Right now, we don’t have a dedicated platform for players, so we rely on forms to track them, which is tough to manage daily with so many people. Stylus will allow us to create a secure, enjoyable place where players can stay engaged. With this all-in-one platform, players can easily join tournaments, earn rewards, and interact with the community, helping us keep them involved and excited about our plans.\n\nFunding Breakdown & Spending Plan\n\nDevelopment: 40% (Smart Contract Development, Blockchain Integration)\nRewards and Retention Program: 25% (Tournaments, Leaderboards, and Rewards)\nMarketing: 10% (Workshops, Web 3 onboarding)\nInfrastructure: 15% (Servers, Security)\nAudits & Security: 10% (Third-party security audits)\n\nTeam Experience\n\nVon Jasper Bongcac (CEO): 8 years in esports management, leading community growth initiatives, and strategic partnerships.\nJoshua Fermin (General Manager): Skilled in partnership management and has led events that draw in both new and experienced players.\nJeremy Alix (Creative Director): Expert in visual branding and community communication, ensuring clear messaging around Web 3 integration.\n\nHas the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?\n\nNo\n\nProject Stage\n\nProject Stage: Ideation and MVP Development\n\nDeployment Date\n\nN/A\n\nPrevious Performance\n\nN/A\n\nHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?\n\nNone\n\nComparable Projects\n\nProjects like Battlefy, but designed to bring traditional Web 2 gamers into a familiar gaming ecosystem enhanced with blockchain elements.\n\nEcosystem Growth Potential\n\nOur project aims to introduce Web 3 games to Web 2 gamers, making it easy for them to experience blockchain features within a familiar environment. This strategy reduces the need for costly advertising with uncertain results, as we can directly engage our large gaming community. By positioning ourselves as the go-to platform that bridges Web 2 gamers with Web 3 games, we aim to foster growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem with a steady flow of new users and developers.\n\nHow do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?\n\nAs of now, our team has limited knowledge in blockchain development. To address this, we plan to hire an experienced blockchain advisor to guide us in implementing Stylus smart contracts, Rust for secure code development, and other relevant blockchain tools that ensure scalability. With the right expertise, we’re confident that we can create a fast, secure, and scalable platform to serve our community’s needs.\n\nHow will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?\n\nZodiacs Gaming plans to expand this project by adding more games and increasing community engagement through constant tournament hosting and rewards. This will help make the platform self-sustaining, driven by sponsorships, premium on-chain assets, and community events.\n\nDo you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?\n\nYes\n\nDiscussion\n\nVon Jasper Bongcac\n\nBuilder\n\n12 Nov\n\nThis proposal was resubmitted\n\n~ Sign in to post comments! ~",
