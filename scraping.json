DetailsWe have proposed and implemented the ultimate solution for meme coins.Our product is a revolutionary innovation.We are creating the next generation of top meme coins.Similar to the PoW mechanism, we also generate a fixed amount of tokens with each block, meaning we use smart contracts to implement and replace the PoW output.This mechanism prevents early participants from obtaining a large quantity of tokens at a low price shortly after the launch.We use smart contract to create real fair meme coin,just like POW BTC/DOGE,we can call it Smart BTC/DOGE.Our product combines memecoin fair launch(SHIB/PEPE/pump.fun) + PoW distribution mechanisms(BTC/Doge) + Dutch auctions(CrazyMeme’s original innovation) + on-chain presales(Bome) + AMM DEX functionality.It’s a business opportunity valued at more than $1 billion to $10 billion, and we will surely become the leading DApp in the industry.We spent nearly a year designing and iterating the product,and launched on Solana mainnet last month.We are integrating EVM chains,and plan to launch on TON/BTC/SUI/Aptos,etc.Member Details1.

Who is your intended target audience?Due to the extreme unfairness in most platforms, 95% of users are afraid to invest in early-stage meme coins, as it’s easy to lose money and difficult to make profit.\nIn fact, many users have left the market after losing money in these early-edge meme coins.\nThe remaining 5% of active users only invest small amounts in them.\nHowever, with the true fairness offered by CrazyMeme, all users in Web3, and even those from Web2, will rush to the CrazyMeme platform to buy early-stage meme coins.\nThe market potential is hundreds of times larger than Pump.fun.\nWe aim to become the leading DApp, surpassing platforms like Pump.fun. CrazyMeme has the potential to achieve daily profits of $5 million within six months, making us the most profitable DApp in Web3 history.Funding Breakdown & Spending PlanContracts development:$250k\nContracts audit:$250kTeam ExperienceWe have a team of 12 people:UI 1,Frontend 3,Backend 3,Smart contract engineer 3,BD 1,Partner 1.Has the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?YesProject StageIt's already live on Solana mainnet.Deployment DateWe launched an initial version on the Solana mainnet in October and plan to release the final version on the Solana mainnet this month.\nAdditionally, we are currently testing EVM-compatible contracts and aim to launch on Arbitrum next month once the contracts are finalized.Previous PerformanceThe traction is small because we haven’t done much promotion yet.Have you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?We have successfully passed the pre-screening stage of the grant program by the Starknet Foundation.\nAlso, we are participating in the Mantle APAC Hackathon.Comparable ProjectsWe are quite different from other platforms(pump.fun) in several ways:\n1.We offer a truly fair meme launch, unlike other platforms, which are quite unfair.\n2.We use Dutch auctions, while other platforms do not. In fact, our approach is the opposite of theirs.\n3.We are a DEX, whereas other platforms are not.\n4.We have implemented extensive multi-indicator data for meme coins, which other platforms haven’t yet integrated.\n5.We are deployed across multiple chains.Ecosystem Growth PotentialCurrently, the initial liquidity of most meme coins is small, and a few hundred to a few thousand people with limited funds can drive the price up by more than 100 times. As a result, the initial user base is small, and this situation is inherent to the mechanism. Eventually, most of the meme coins will fail.\nOn the contrary, CrazyMeme uses Dutch auctions to distribute tokens linearly into the liquidity by block. This allows CrazyMeme meme tokens to accommodate tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of users during the auction cycle. Through this mechanism, the meme coins on CrazyMeme will have a much higher chance of becoming top MEMEs, with the market cap potentially reaching $1B, $10B, or even higher.How do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?We spent nearly a year designing and iterating the product,and launched on Solana mainnet last month.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?We have numerous long-term plans for our product, including:\n1.\tMobile Wallet: A feature designed to enable users to conveniently purchase meme coins directly through their smartphones.\n2.\tLeverage Products: Offering leverage options so users can long meme coins with leverage or even short them.\n3.\tSocial Features: Beyond buying and selling meme coins, we aim to introduce social functionalities, allowing users to spend more time engaging with our platform. A meme coin platform is ideal for incorporating social elements since we anticipate having tens or even hundreds of millions of users in the future. With such a massive user base, developing a social ecosystem would be highly suitable.\n4.\tLive Streaming/Short Video: We are even exploring the possibility of including live-streaming and short video functionalities in the future.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussion....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

    "proposalText": "Super Tiny WorldFunding Ask300,000 ARBSubmitted on28 Nov, 2024Milestones3tl;drSuper Tiny World is an iterative, micro, social JRPG with character customization and asset ownership for mobile gaming.DetailsSanko is an OP roll up orbit chain from Arbitrum. It’s focus is on social/gaming, and already has a rich and energetic grassroots culture of developers and builders. Without VC funding it has quickly become one of the top L3 orbit chains due to cult community and meme-ability. Every transaction on-chain has a burning mechanism that burns the native gas token $DMT. Their first major product, Sanko.tv, shipped over a year ago and at the time was the first of its kind. Their second major product is SankoPets, an on-chain pet simulator with built-in defi mechanisms. In order to stake $DMT users must own a pet. These pets can also farm Fruit and sell them for native gaming token SankoGold.We want to build a mobile p2e JRPG game that leverages these assets emitted from Sankopets. In Super Tiny World, players create a character between 3 different classes and play through a scenario to level out their character and earn $ZENNY along the way. This $ZENNY will be used to purchase short term buffs, swap out gear, purchase extra character slots, purchase Potions (created from Sankopets ‘Fruit’) or SankoGold.During the scenario, players will have so much Stamina to expend throughout their playtime, diminishing their stats to a weakened state. Players can risk continuing in a weakened state, losing their $ZENNY if they fail to complete the stage, partner up with others sharing $ZENNY and XP gained, purchase Potions to regain their energy, or wait for their Stamina to slowly replenish over time.In order to upgrade their character, players will need to earn the XP through playing the game to unlock skills and purchase and use SankoGold to unlock. Weapon variety will be utilized in the game to balance out gameplay, while specific rarity or weapons will be flattened so rare equipment is only for aesthetic purposes like skins, that can be owned in wallet and traded as NFTs.The game will start with an initial player base of 8,888 NFT holders, later onboarding a F2P player base. In order to onboard free players, we will utilize a ERC-404 with single sided swapping mechanism. Every 1 NFT burned will add an amount to distributed supply, and open up a batch of F2P players. We will have a burning mechanism built in, so every transaction burns $ZENNY, so in times when player growth is stagnant the token becomes deflationary. There will also be a built in mechanism in the game to buy-back and burn NFTs to continue onboarding new players through player interaction.The leveraging of secondary assets from Sankopets allows us to reward early liquidity providers and lock up a percentage of distributed/circulating $ZENNY supply through a 3 or 6 month unbonding period, which will prevent tokens earned in game from being insta-dumped. We want to encourage players to spend $ZENNY earned in-game on playing the game and building out their characters.Ultimately, Super Tiny World is not just a game, but a way for players to build out an identity on-chain they will be able to utilize in other experiences in the future in Sanko. We want players to have as much freedom in creating their characters as possible. Asset ownership in gaming is an opportunity for artists to have a living canvas, and for their work to be expressed as an IP. Games can become IP factories to build brand recognition across a variety of platforms. Someone sees a sword, hat, or specific design, and they immediately can identify it back to a specific artist or game.Member Details1. Huffy (Director)2. STW.WTS (Artist) -- @stwwwts / stwwts.com3.

DetailsWe are extending the Passport XYZ platform to allow users to aggregate identity “Stamps” from multiple wallets privately and efficiently. Today, each wallet can only hold a narrow slice of a user’s onchain reputation, leading to fragmented scores and suboptimal trust signals. We will integrate with Arbitrum Stylus to implement a contract flow inspired by Tornado Cash, but for credential proofs instead of tokens. Users “deposit” credential proofs from various wallets into a Stylus-powered contract. Later, from any chosen address, they can present a zero-knowledge style proof that they hold these credentials—without revealing the source wallets. This process enhances Sybil resistance, improves user experience, and preserves privacy. By leveraging WASM and Rust-based logic via Stylus, we reduce gas costs and complexity, making onchain identity aggregation more accessible. The final result is a seamless, privacy-focused identity layer ready to serve dApps, DAOs, and DeFi projects on Arbitrum.Member Details1. Kyle Weiss -- Co-founder of both Gitcoin and Passport XYZ2.

By leveraging Arbitrum Stylus, we can implement efficient, cost-effective verification logic in WASM for complex identity proofs—similar to Tornado Cash’s deposit/withdrawal privacy mechanics, but for credentials instead of tokens. This enables trustless, Sybil-resistant identity aggregation without linking personal addresses directly, preserving user privacy. The innovation lies in making these advanced credential proofs cheaper and more accessible on Arbitrum, unlocking frictionless human-verification use cases for dApps and communities. And showcasing how Stylus’s low cost computation enables identity and other use cases that cannot occur due to high gas costs on mainnet.What users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?Our solution targets both end-users and Web3 projects that rely on Sybil-resistant identities. Current identity solutions are fragmented; users often build reputations across multiple wallets, but cannot easily combine them without doxxing themselves. This leads to lower-quality scores, reduced access to gated benefits, and complexity in proving one’s trustworthiness. Our intended audience includes:\nUsers: Who want to prove unique humanity without linking multiple wallets publicly.\nPartners & dApps: That require high-quality, Sybil-resistant user bases for rewards, governance, and community-building.\nBy enabling privacy-preserving multi-wallet identity aggregation, we simplify verification, boost user participation, and increase overall ecosystem trust.Funding Breakdown & Spending PlanTotal Request: 100k ARB\nDevelopment & Engineering (60k ARB)\nImplementing the Stylus-based credential aggregation contracts, integrating Rust-based ZK or privacy proofs, and optimizing for gas costs.\nInterface design and front end development (20k ARB)\nDesigning and implementing a new user interface for app.passport.xyz to enable users to claim on multiple wallets.\nTesting & Integration (10k ARB)\nDeploying to testnets, refining UX, and stress-testing performance.\nDocumentation & Community Outreach (10k ARB)\nCreating developer guides, user instructions, and onboarding materials for partners and end-users.Team ExperienceOur core team combines expertise in Web3 identity, privacy, and smart contract engineering.\nThe team has collectively launched multiple production-grade dApps, integrated complex off-chain verification flows, and implemented advanced cryptographic tooling.\nOur experience bridging user-friendly front-ends with robust, privacy-focused back-end infrastructures uniquely qualifies us to deliver a secure, efficient, and intuitive privacy-preserving identity aggregation solution on Arbitrum Stylus.Has the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?YesProject StageWe currently have a functioning identity verification platform (app.passport.xyz) and are in the design phase for extending it to multi-wallet privacy aggregation. We have identified the approach, feasibility, and cost. Upon grant approval, we can begin immediate development.Deployment Date6-8 weeks after funding, to allow for us to balance and make room in our roadmapPrevious PerformancePassport XYZ has successfully deployed and operated its identity verification platform, integrating a variety of credential sources and achieving traction with Web3 projects looking to combat Sybil attacks.\nOur existing Passport App has onboarded 2 million users who have verified Stamps and established onchain identities.\nWe have partnered with 100+ communities and dApps to ensure that their token distributions and governance activities benefit unique, high-quality participants.Have you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?Yes – We received a 24k ARB Fire Starter grant from Thank ARB. We have also received grants from Optimism’s RPGF and Gitcoin Grants GG22.Comparable ProjectsOther Web3 identity solutions often rely on static claims or singular verification pathways, limiting their flexibility and utility. BrightID uses a social-graph approach, Proof of Humanity relies on community-curated registries, Worldcoin explores biometric verification, and IDENA conducts synchronous ceremonies. While these solutions help prove uniqueness, they lack composability and privacy-preserving aggregation. Our approach enables users to aggregate identity attributes—stamps, credentialsEcosystem Growth PotentialBy making it easier for users to establish stronger, Sybil-resistant reputations without sacrificing privacy, our solution will encourage broader participation in governance, reward programs, and other community-driven initiatives on Arbitrum. This leads to a healthier ecosystem with improved user trust and better incentive alignment. As more partners integrate and rely on privacy-preserving identity scoring, the Arbitrum ecosystem can expand its user base and unlock more sophisticated use cases—such as fair airdrops, Sybil-resistance voting, and tailored access to protocols—ultimately driving increased adoption, high quality engagement, retention, and utility within the Arbitrum network.How do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?We have experience integrating various identity Stamps and working with privacy-focused proof systems. Stylus’ WASM execution environment allows us to leverage Rust-based cryptographic libraries. We have surveyed the Rust and WASM ecosystems for suitable ZK libraries (e.g., arkworks) and have confirmed compatibility with Stylus. The approach is feasible given the team’s technical background and the existence of robust Rust crates.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?This functionality will be integrated directly into Passport XYZ, a revenue-generating platform. Ongoing fees from partners using our Sybil-resistant scoring and consulting services will sustain maintenance and future development. As more dApps adopt privacy-preserving unique-human verification, demand grows. We will actively maintain and upgrade contracts, continue user education, and cultivate community involvement, ensuring relevance beyond the initial grant period.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussionDaniel BrunsdonBuilder17 DecThis proposal was resubmittedDaniel BrunsdonBuilder17 DecThis proposal was resubmitted....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

By integrating Stylus-specific host functions and leveraging the power of property-based testing, the tool will uncover hidden bugs and edge cases with unparalleled precision. It streamlines testing workflows for Rust-based WASM contracts, enhancing security, correctness, and developer confidence, and fills a critical gap in the Arbitrum ecosystem’s tooling landscape.What users and pain points in the market does this project solve for? Who is your intended target audience?StylusFuzz targets Rust developers, protocol teams, and security researchers building on Stylus within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Developers often face challenges such as identifying edge-case bugs and vulnerabilities, limited access to advanced testing tools, and inefficient manual testing processes. Protocol teams building complex dApps struggle with ensuring the robustness of smart contracts critical to their projects, while security researchers need precise tools to uncover vulnerabilities and validate contract security. StylusFuzz directly addresses these pain points by providing a property-based fuzzing framework tailored specifically for Stylus contracts, integrating essential host functions, and enabling systematic testing and debugging. This tool empowers developers to efficiently test contract logic and security, reducing development overhead while improving contract reliability.Funding Breakdown & Spending PlanPhase 1: 62500 ARB for the development of a prototype fuzzing tool with initial Stylus support.\nPhase 2: 150000 ARB to extend support for all Stylus contracts and implement feedback.\nPhase 3: 150000 ARB to improve UX, optimize performance, and ensure community adoption.Team ExperienceRuntime Verification has a proven track record of developing testing tools for blockchain ecosystems, including Komet for Stellar Soroban and Kasmer for MultiversX, both designed for property-based fuzzing and verification. These tools leverage WebAssembly (WASM) semantics, which aligns closely with the objectives of this project for Stylus. Our team consists of experienced engineers with deep expertise in formal methods, fuzzing, and smart contract security, making us uniquely qualified to build this tool for the Arbitrum ecosystem. We also bring hands-on experience in integrating fuzzing capabilities with blockchain-specific host functions and optimizing developer workflows.Has the current team already onboarded the key personnel required to complete the tasks or project for which they are applying for the grant?YesProject StageIdeation / Prototyping. The project is currently in the ideation phase with detailed plans and milestones outlined. The development will begin with the construction of the foundational prototype in Phase 1.Deployment DateN/APrevious PerformanceN/AHave you previously received a grant from the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, any Arbitrum ecosystem related program, or another blockchain ecosystem?NoComparable ProjectsAfter extensive market research, no comparable projects have been identified that provide Stylus-specific property-based fuzzing tools.Ecosystem Growth PotentialEvery developer building on Stylus requires robust testing tools to ensure security and functionality. This tool addresses a critical need in the developer journey, enabling both property-based fuzzing and advanced debugging for Rust-based smart contracts on Stylus. By providing a seamless testing solution, we aim to accelerate developer adoption of Stylus and enhance the overall security and reliability of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Furthermore, this tool will attract security researchers and protocol teams, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of secure decentralized applications.How do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?We plan to implement StylusFuzz in three phases: building a prototype with core Stylus support, extending to full contract support, and optimizing UX and performance for adoption. Our tools leverage the K framework, enabling us to extend KWasm semantics with Stylus-specific host functions. This approach ensures seamless integration with the Stylus environment and robust testing capabilities. Our expertise with similar tools, like Komet for Stellar, and engagement with the Stylus team validate the feasibility and demand for this solution in the Arbitrum ecosystem.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?To ensure long-term project sustainability, Runtime Verification will continue to support and maintain the tool as open-source. We plan to integrate CI pipeline support for enterprise users and provide managed infrastructure for large-scale fuzzing through premium offerings. The tool will evolve with community contributions and will remain accessible under an OSI-compliant license. Potential risks include updates in Arbitrum’s infrastructure, which we plan to mitigate by closely collaborating with the Stylus team and maintaining flexibility in our architecture.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussionRuntime Verification (Everett Hildenbrandt / Gregory Makodzeba)Builder04 DecThis proposal was resubmittedRuntime Verification (Everett Hildenbrandt / Gregory Makodzeba)Builder04 DecThis proposal was resubmitted....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

The closest Web2 project is Clash of Clans, which features clan management and competitive gameplay. Ramen Rumble brings similar features  but with more immersion to Web3, enhancing them with NFTs and decentralized economies, offering unique value to Arbitrum.'Ecosystem Growth PotentialOur project, Ramen Rumble, is designed to attract a massive new audience to the Arbitrum ecosystem by bridging Web2 and Web3 gaming. With immersive gameplay that hides blockchain complexity, we simplify onboarding for non-crypto-native players while providing advanced features for Web3 enthusiasts. By integrating Arbitrum’s high-performance infrastructure, we showcase its scalability for gaming applications, encouraging other game developers to build on Arbitrum. Additionally, the game’s use of NFTs, in-game economies, and community-driven events fosters engagement and retention, creating a thriving user base. This growth not only boosts adoption but also attracts new projects and protocols seeking to tap into Arbitrum’s vibrant ecosystem.How do you plan on implementing your project & have you done some due diligence on the feasibility of your idea with respect to the tools/frameworks currently available?We are currently in the MVP stage and have conducted due diligence regarding the tools and frameworks to implement our project. We use Unity as our primary game engine for its versatility and cross-platform support. For multiplayer functionality, we rely on Photon, ensuring smooth and scalable real-time interactions. Thirdweb API facilitates seamless logins, wallet integrations, and onramp solutions, simplifying onboarding. Firebase serves as our database for robust and scalable backend operations, while Bunny.net is used as a distribution server to ensure efficient and fast content delivery. These tools collectively enable us to deliver a high-quality, scalable product.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?Ramen Rumble's long-term sustainability relies on a multi-faceted approach:\n•\tDiverse Revenue Streams: NFTs, in-app purchases, and non-intrusive ads ensure ongoing income.\n•\tCommunity Building: We are fostering a dedicated community through regular events, competitions, and content updates, increasing player retention.\n•\tContent Roadmap: Expanding gameplay with new features, dishes, weapons, and game modes will maintain player interest and attract new users.\n•\tPartnerships: Collaborating with other projects and DAOs will enhance visibility and broaden our reach.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussionLoading...Loading comments, please wait.....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

The AssemblyScript SDK for Stylus aims to create a complete development framework enabling TypeScript developers to write Stylus smart contracts with familiar syntax. The project leverages AssemblyScript's efficient WebAssembly compilation to deliver:Full-featured SDK mirroring Stylus Rust SDK capabilities for smart contract developmentOptimized WebAssembly compilation pipeline with efficient build system and size optimizationsPurpose-built as-stylus CLI tool for project scaffolding, build optimization, and contract managementHybrid tooling approach combining as-stylus CLI with cargo-stylus for seamless deployment and verificationType system mapping AssemblyScript to EVM types with proper ABI compatibilityComprehensive testing framework and development environment integrationsVM hooks implementation for full EVM environment access with AssemblyScript bindingsStorage layer with caching optimizations and Solidity-compatible layoutsComprehensive documentation, guides, and example smart contractsImplementation Strategy1. Core SDK Architecture:Design a modular SDK structure mirroring the Stylus Rust SDK's architecture, with dedicated modules for storage, EVM interactions, contract calls, and cryptographic operationsImplement VM hooks (host-io functions) that interface with Stylus's WebAssembly runtime to access the EVM environmentCreate a custom compiler toolchain to ensure the AssemblyScript code compiles to WASM bytecode that meets Stylus's validation requirements and 24KB compressed size limit2. Storage Management:Develop AssemblyScript equivalents of Stylus's storage types (StorageAddress, StorageUint, StorageBool, etc.)Implement an optimal storage caching strategy similar to Rust SDK to minimize SLOAD/SSTORE operationsCreate type-safe storage collections (vectors, maps, arrays) with proper Solidity ABI compatibilityDesign storage layouts that maintain compatibility with Solidity's storage patterns for seamless integration3. ABI Compatibility Layer:Build a type system that maps AssemblyScript primitives to Ethereum types (address, uint256, bytes, etc.)Implement function selector computation and ABI encoding/decodingCreate decorators (@external, @view, @payable) to mark contract functions with proper visibility and mutabilityDevelop macros or code generation tools to automatically export Solidity interfaces4. Contract Interoperability:Design interfaces for cross-contract calls between AssemblyScript and other Stylus/Solidity contractsImplement safe call patterns with proper reentrancy protectionCreate type-safe wrappers for common contract interactions (transfer, delegatecall, etc.)Support inheritance patterns compatible with Solidity's composition model5. VM Integration:Implement bindings for all Stylus VM affordances (block, msg, tx objects)Create efficient gas metering through Stylus's ink systemSupport event emission with proper topic encodingImplement error handling patterns compatible with EVM reversion6. Development Toolchain:Develop lightweight as-stylus CLI for AssemblyScript-specific compilation and project managementIntegrate with cargo-stylus for deployment and verification workflowsCreate development utilities for testing, and build optimizationDevelopment Toolchain for SDKThe SDK will utilize a hybrid approach for tooling that combines a lightweight AssemblyScript-specific CLI with the robust capabilities of the existing cargo-stylus infrastructure:AssemblyScript CLI (as-stylus)Handles AssemblyScript-specific compilation to WASMManages SDK configuration and project scaffoldingGenerates contract ABIs from AssemblyScript codePerforms WASM optimization and size validationProvides development utilities and testing framework integrationIntegration with cargo-stylusRather than duplicating deployment and verification logic, the SDK will leverage cargo-stylus's battle-tested capabilities through its --wasm-file flag for:Contract deploymentContract activationOnchain verificationRPC interaction handlingThis approach optimally balances development efficiency by:Avoiding duplication of deployment/verification logicMaintaining compatibility with the broader Stylus ecosystemReducing long-term maintenance burdenFocusing development efforts on AssemblyScript-specific tooling needsTechnical Feasibility Analysis1. AssemblyScript Compatibility:AssemblyScript already compiles to WebAssembly efficientlyThe language's static typing system allows for proper type safety and optimizationExisting tools like as-bind can help with WebAssembly/host environment interactionsAssemblyScript's low-level memory model enables precise control over data layouts2. Stylus Requirements:AssemblyScript can meet Stylus's deterministic execution requirementsThe language supports custom allocators necessary for blockchain memory managementWebAssembly compilation can be optimized to meet size constraintsType system can be extended to support Ethereum-specific types3. Development Tools:as-stylus CLI can handle AssemblyScript-specific needsCan leverage cargo-stylus's existing deployment and verification infrastructureAssemblyScript compiler (asc) provides necessary hooks for custom build toolingExisting WebAssembly optimization tools (wasm-opt) can be integrated well with the build pipelineProject scaffolding can follow established patterns from other AssemblyScript tools4. Integration Points:AssemblyScript's TypeScript-like syntax enables familiar developer experienceCan integrate with existing Ethereum development tools (Hardhat, Foundry)Supports interaction with Arbitrum's L2 specific featuresCompatible with existing block explorers and verification toolsSecurity Considerations:The AssemblyScript SDK will be developed with security as a top priority, implementing robust safeguards, storage safety mechanisms, and strict type checking etc. The SDK will follow security patterns established in the audited Stylus Rust SDK (https://blog.openzeppelin.com/stylus-rust-sdk-audit), while adapting them for the AssemblyScript.Key security features will include proper storage access validation, deterministic builds for contract verification, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. Documentation will also clearly outline security best practices for developers. Besides, to ensure the highest security standards, I will conduct a professional security audit of the SDK and tooling before mainnet deployment. The audit will verify the SDK's security model, identify potential vulnerabilities, and validate the implementation of security controls.Member Details1.

    "proposalText": "Stylus AssemblyScript SDK - MertFunding Ask150,000 ARBSubmitted on15 Nov, 2024Milestones5tl;drDeveloping AssemblyScript SDK for Arbitrum Stylus, enabling devs to write smart contracts in TypeScript-like syntax.DetailsCategory/Idea: As the developer of the Arbitrum Python SDK (which has garnered over 2,600 downloads since July 2024), I bring substantial experience in creating developer tools for the Arbitrum ecosystem. The AssemblyScript SDK for Stylus aims to create a complete development framework enabling TypeScript developers to write Stylus smart contracts with familiar syntax. The project leverages AssemblyScript's efficient WebAssembly compilation to deliver:Full-featured SDK mirroring Stylus Rust SDK capabilities for smart contract developmentOptimized WebAssembly compilation pipeline with efficient build system and size optimizationsPurpose-built as-stylus CLI tool for project scaffolding, build optimization, and contract managementHybrid tooling approach combining as-stylus CLI with cargo-stylus for seamless deployment and verificationType system mapping AssemblyScript to EVM types with proper ABI compatibilityComprehensive testing framework and development environment integrationsVM hooks implementation for full EVM environment access with AssemblyScript bindingsStorage layer with caching optimizations and Solidity-compatible layoutsComprehensive documentation, guides, and example smart contractsImplementation Strategy1. Core SDK Architecture:Design a modular SDK structure mirroring the Stylus Rust SDK's architecture, with dedicated modules for storage, EVM interactions, contract calls, and cryptographic operationsImplement VM hooks (host-io functions) that interface with Stylus's WebAssembly runtime to access the EVM environmentCreate a custom compiler toolchain to ensure the AssemblyScript code compiles to WASM bytecode that meets Stylus's validation requirements and 24KB compressed size limit2. Storage Management:Develop AssemblyScript equivalents of Stylus's storage types (StorageAddress, StorageUint, StorageBool, etc.)Implement an optimal storage caching strategy similar to Rust SDK to minimize SLOAD/SSTORE operationsCreate type-safe storage collections (vectors, maps, arrays) with proper Solidity ABI compatibilityDesign storage layouts that maintain compatibility with Solidity's storage patterns for seamless integration3. ABI Compatibility Layer:Build a type system that maps AssemblyScript primitives to Ethereum types (address, uint256, bytes, etc.)Implement function selector computation and ABI encoding/decodingCreate decorators (@external, @view, @payable) to mark contract functions with proper visibility and mutabilityDevelop macros or code generation tools to automatically export Solidity interfaces4. Contract Interoperability:Design interfaces for cross-contract calls between AssemblyScript and other Stylus/Solidity contractsImplement safe call patterns with proper reentrancy protectionCreate type-safe wrappers for common contract interactions (transfer, delegatecall, etc.)Support inheritance patterns compatible with Solidity's composition model5. VM Integration:Implement bindings for all Stylus VM affordances (block, msg, tx objects)Create efficient gas metering through Stylus's ink systemSupport event emission with proper topic encodingImplement error handling patterns compatible with EVM reversion6. Development Toolchain:Develop lightweight as-stylus CLI for AssemblyScript-specific compilation and project managementIntegrate with cargo-stylus for deployment and verification workflowsCreate development utilities for testing, and build optimizationDevelopment Toolchain for SDKThe SDK will utilize a hybrid approach for tooling that combines a lightweight AssemblyScript-specific CLI with the robust capabilities of the existing cargo-stylus infrastructure:AssemblyScript CLI (as-stylus)Handles AssemblyScript-specific compilation to WASMManages SDK configuration and project scaffoldingGenerates contract ABIs from AssemblyScript codePerforms WASM optimization and size validationProvides development utilities and testing framework integrationIntegration with cargo-stylusRather than duplicating deployment and verification logic, the SDK will leverage cargo-stylus's battle-tested capabilities through its --wasm-file flag for:Contract deploymentContract activationOnchain verificationRPC interaction handlingThis approach optimally balances development efficiency by:Avoiding duplication of deployment/verification logicMaintaining compatibility with the broader Stylus ecosystemReducing long-term maintenance burdenFocusing development efforts on AssemblyScript-specific tooling needsTechnical Feasibility Analysis1. AssemblyScript Compatibility:AssemblyScript already compiles to WebAssembly efficientlyThe language's static typing system allows for proper type safety and optimizationExisting tools like as-bind can help with WebAssembly/host environment interactionsAssemblyScript's low-level memory model enables precise control over data layouts2. Stylus Requirements:AssemblyScript can meet Stylus's deterministic execution requirementsThe language supports custom allocators necessary for blockchain memory managementWebAssembly compilation can be optimized to meet size constraintsType system can be extended to support Ethereum-specific types3. Development Tools:as-stylus CLI can handle AssemblyScript-specific needsCan leverage cargo-stylus's existing deployment and verification infrastructureAssemblyScript compiler (asc) provides necessary hooks for custom build toolingExisting WebAssembly optimization tools (wasm-opt) can be integrated well with the build pipelineProject scaffolding can follow established patterns from other AssemblyScript tools4. Integration Points:AssemblyScript's TypeScript-like syntax enables familiar developer experienceCan integrate with existing Ethereum development tools (Hardhat, Foundry)Supports interaction with Arbitrum's L2 specific featuresCompatible with existing block explorers and verification toolsSecurity Considerations:The AssemblyScript SDK will be developed with security as a top priority, implementing robust safeguards, storage safety mechanisms, and strict type checking etc. The SDK will follow security patterns established in the audited Stylus Rust SDK (https://blog.openzeppelin.com/stylus-rust-sdk-audit), while adapting them for the AssemblyScript.Key security features will include proper storage access validation, deterministic builds for contract verification, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. Documentation will also clearly outline security best practices for developers. Besides, to ensure the highest security standards, I will conduct a professional security audit of the SDK and tooling before mainnet deployment. The audit will verify the SDK's security model, identify potential vulnerabilities, and validate the implementation of security controls.Member Details1.

By eliminating centralized control and geographic restrictions, the DPP combines the transparency of decentralized finance with the excitement of sports and event prediction markets. Users can place bets using any token, including $ETH, $SP, or other cryptocurrencies, thanks to seamless cross-chain functionality powered by LayerZero Core. With parlay options, users can create multi-bet combinations that compound odds for significant payouts—turning a series of accurate predictions into exponential rewards. Built on Arbitrum Stylus, the DPP ensures scalability, ultra-low transaction costs, and optimal performance, setting a new standard for decentralized betting platforms.A standout feature of the DPP is its NFT-driven functionality, where each parlay sheet is minted as a unique NFT. This innovation transforms betting into a tradeable and liquid asset class. Users can buy, sell, or exchange these NFTs on OverTheCounter.meme, Smoovie Phone’s decentralized P2P token exchange. This feature allows users to enter or exit betting positions dynamically, even after the betting window closes, by acquiring parlay sheets from other users. Combined with the platform’s seamless Rust-based architecture on Stylus, this functionality creates an intersection of DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, delivering a holistic and flexible betting experience. By turning bets into assets, the DPP introduces a decentralized and community-driven secondary market that amplifies the excitement and accessibility of the platform.The “Be the Bank” feature further enhances the platform by empowering users to act as liquidity providers. By depositing tokens like $ETH or $SP into the platform's rewards pool, users can earn passive yield from parlay sheets that fail to win. This mechanism shares profits with liquidity providers, creating an ecosystem where participants collectively benefit from platform activity. The rewards pool is transparently managed on Arbitrum Stylus, leveraging its performance capabilities for seamless fund management and instant profit distribution. This DeFi-inspired functionality democratizes the betting process, enabling users to profit in ways previously limited to centralized betting operators.The platform’s user interface (UI) is a visual and functional delight, blending retro gaming aesthetics with cutting-edge technology. Inspired by Sanko Predicts, the UI features parlay sheets that resemble handwritten notes, adding a personal and nostalgic touch to the betting experience. Victories are celebrated with dynamic animations that enhance the thrill of winning. Additionally, the DPP features a live chat function, enabling users to connect with bettors worldwide or interact directly with kAia, the platform’s AI assistant. From resolving queries and providing betting insights to sharing market updates and engaging users with playful banter, kAia ensures a seamless and engaging experience for all participants.At the core of the DPP’s technical infrastructure is Arbitrum Stylus, enabling high-performance operations and seamless multi-chain interactions. The Rust-based architecture allows for rapid bet resolutions, transparent odds management, and efficient NFT minting. Stylus also powers kAia’s AI-driven functionalities, ensuring real-time data integration and robust user support. By integrating Stylus, the DPP delivers a frictionless and innovative experience that transforms decentralized betting into an empowering and scalable ecosystem. With tradable NFT parlay sheets, the “Be the Bank” liquidity model, and an intuitive UI enhanced by kAia’s support, the DPP is poised to redefine crypto betting, setting a precedent for decentralized applications in Web3.Member Details1. revolver ocelot Project Linkshttps://sankopredicts.com/, smooviephone.com (all products)Point of Contact0xsimplefarmerDiscord@simplefarmer7KYC/KYB AcknowledgmentYesTrackOpen ApplicationRequested Grant Size420,000 $ARBInnovation & Novelty: Highlight what unique aspect or innovation your project brings to ArbitrumThe be the bank feature where users can take the position of the bank deposit tokens and earn yield from parlay bets places , also the model includes A.I resolving bets which is unique to the market at this time.What users and pain points in the market does this project solve for?

We intend to utilize Arbitrum Stylus for its unparalleled performance in enabling Rust-based smart contract development. Stylus’s compatibility with high-performance programming languages like Rust allows us to efficiently develop, deploy, and scale the core components of the DPP, including its bet resolution engine, rewards pool management system, and NFT minting processes.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?The sustainability of the Decentralized Parlay Platform (DPP) is modeled after the consistent growth strategy employed by FanDuel, which focused on delivering exceptional user experiences, retaining customers through innovative offerings, and expanding its user base with effective marketing. The initial boost provided by the Arbitrum Stylus grant will allow us to accelerate the platform's development, deploy essential features, and attract an initial user base through targeted campaigns and incentivized adoption. This critical early-stage momentum will lay the groundwork for a strong, engaged community that we can grow sustainably.\nPositive community growth, built on the foundation of the Smoovie Phone ($SP) ecosystem, will also ensure sustainability. In just four months, we have cultivated a thriving and engaged user base for Smoovie Phone, thanks to innovative features like P2P token swaps and bridge listings. This proven ability to foster vibrant communities will translate to the DPP, as we engage users with reward programs, gamification, and community-driven initiatives. By encouraging feedback and fostering active participation, we’ll create a strong sense of ownership among our users, leading to organic growth and sustained platform usage.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussion0xsimplefarmerBuilder24 NovThis proposal was resubmitted....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",

Given the 24kb size limit on Stylus-compiled contracts, our approach will focus on single-threaded computation for small-scale data analytics and data mining. We’ll develop compact, efficient contracts tailored to these needs, making them accessible via the Abakhus-Stylus API. For contract interaction within the API, we’ll utilize tools like Foundry, while the API itself will be built using Node and React, supported by libraries like Express for streamlined performance.How will you ensure the long-term sustainability of your project after the end of the program?Upon project completion, our team will continue developing and refining Rust smart contracts for data mining and analytics, deploying them on Arbitrum mainnet through Abakhus-Stylus. These contracts will also be accessible to developers for prototyping and deploying new dApps via Abakhus-Protocol. Our monetization strategy includes (i) charging a fee for Abakhus-Protocol API usage in production mode, and/or (ii) providing consultancy for dApp development, ensuring a sustainable future for Abakhus-Stylus.\nHowever, there are potential risks, including dependency on limited revenue streams, low platform adoption, and maintaining a competitive edge as other solutions emerge. To address these, we’ll diversify revenue channels by introducing additional services like premium features or strategic partnerships to build resilience. To drive adoption, we’ll emphasize targeted marketing, active community engagement, and continual innovation. Regular updates and a strong focus on scalability within the Arbitrum ecosystem will further support our long-term competitive positioning.Do you acknowledge that, from the moment in which the grant is approved, you have up to 1 year to KYC/KYB and complete the deliverable specified in this grant?YesDiscussionBlockchain Innovation HubBuilder12 NovThis proposal was resubmitted....CommunityFeedback / CommentType your comment herePost~ Sign in to post comments! ~",
